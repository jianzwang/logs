- Unlike Rc<T>, the RefCell<T> type represents single ownership over the data it holds. So,what makes RefCell<T> different from a type like Box<T>? Recall the borrowing rules youlearned in Chapter 4:
  
  * At any given time, you can have either (but not both of) one mutable reference or anynumber of immutable references.
  * References must always be valid.
