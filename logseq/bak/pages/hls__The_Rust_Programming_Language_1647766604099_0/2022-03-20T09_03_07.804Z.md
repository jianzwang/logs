- A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types intoone compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrinkin size.We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Eachposition in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don’t haveto be the same

- # Functions

- Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names, inwhich all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.

- Statements do not return values.

- You can return early from a function by using the return keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly.

- But if we place a semicolon at the endof the line containing x + 1, changing it from an expression to a statement, we’ll get anerror.

- Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.
