- Deref coercion was added to Rust so that programmers writing function and method calls donâ€™t need to add as many explicit references and dereferences with & and *. The deref coercion feature also lets us write more code that can work for either references or smart pointers.
- you can use the **DerefMut trait** to override the * operator on mutable references.
- Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:
  * From &T to &U when T: Deref<Target=U>From &mut T to &mut U when T: DerefMut<Target=U>From &mut T to &U when T: Deref<Target=U>
