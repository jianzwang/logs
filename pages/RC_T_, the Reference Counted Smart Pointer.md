title:: RC<T>, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer

- ((6236efd9-20f8-4198-8d90-245352a3e6e4))
- To enable multiple ownership, Rust has a type called **Rc<T>**, which is an abbreviation for reference counting.
- The **Rc<T>** type keeps track of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not the value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value can be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.
- We use the Rc<T> type when we want to allocate some data on the heap for multiple parts of our program to read and we canâ€™t determine at compile time which part will finish using the data last.
- **Cloning** an Rc<T> Increases the Reference Count
