- There is no way to define a struct that inherits the parent structâ€™s fields and method implementations.
	- choose inheritance for two main reasons. One is for reuse of code:
		- can implement particular behavior for one type, and inheritance enables you to reuse that implementation for a different type.
			- can share Rust code using default [[trait method]] implementations
			- can also override the default implementation of the method when we implement the trait
	- to enable a child type to be used in the same places as the parent type. This is also called _polymorphism, which means that you can substitute multiple objects for each other at runtime if they share certain characteristics. _
		- Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is sometimes called _bounded parametric polymorphism._
