- Rust canâ€™t figure out how much space to allocate for recursively defined types
- store the value indirectly by storing a pointer to the value instead.
- The Box<T> type is a smart pointer because it implements the [[Deref trait]], which allows Box<T> values to be treated like references.
- When a Box<T> value goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is pointing to is cleaned up as well because of the [[Drop trait]] implementation.
