- A channel in programming has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver.
	- One part of your code calls methods on the transmitter with the data you want to send, and another part checks the receiving end for arriving messages. A channel is said to be closed if either the transmitter or receiver half is dropped.
- The abbreviations **tx** and **rx** are traditionally used in many fields for transmitter and receiver respectively, so we name our variables as such to indicate each end.
- **send**
	- The **send** method returns a Result<T, E> type
- **recv** and **try_recv**
	- **recv** will block the thread's execution and wait until a value is sent down the channel. Once a value is sent, **recv** will return it in a Result<T, E>. When the sending end of the channel closes, **recv** will return an error to signal that no morevalues will be coming.
