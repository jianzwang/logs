- ## Defining a Trait for Common Behavior
	- The advantage of using trait objects and Rust’s type system to write code similar to code using duck typing is that we never have to check whether a value implements a particular method at runtime or worry about getting errors if a value doesn’t implement a method bu tuse Rust won’t compile our code if the values don’t implement the traits that the trait objects need.
