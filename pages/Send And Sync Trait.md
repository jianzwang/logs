	- Almost every Rust type is Send, but there are some exceptions, including [[RC<T>, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer]] Rc<T>: this cannot be Send because if you cloned an **Rc<T>** value and tried to transfer ownership of the clone to another thread, both threads might update the reference count at the same time.
	- For this reason, **Rc<T>** is implemented for use in single-threaded situations where you don’t want to pay the thread-safe performance penalty.

	- any type T is Sync if &T (an immutable reference to T) is Send, meaning the reference can be sent safely to another thread.
	- Similar to Send, primitive types are Sync, and types composed entirely of types that are Sync are also Sync.
	- The [[RC<T>, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer]] smart pointer Rc<T> is also not Sync for the same reasons that it’s not Send. The [[RefCell<T> and the Interior Mutability Pattern]]  RefCell<T> type and the family of related Cell<T>types are not Sync.
