- Almost every Rust type is Send, but there are some exceptions, including [[RC<T>, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer]] Rc<T>: this cannot be Send because if you cloned an **Rc<T>** value and tried to transfer ownership of the clone to another thread, both threads might update the reference count at the same time.
- For this reason, **Rc<T>** is implemented for use in single-threaded situations where you donâ€™t want to pay the thread-safe performance penalty.
